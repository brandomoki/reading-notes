**Growth mindset** _to me is the ability to constantly improve ones self  
by being open minded and always wanting to learn more._
  1. Staying open minded
  2. Put forth the effort to learn
  3. Admit that you dont know everything

> Hello, world. My name is Brandon. Pronouns are he/him. I live in Las Vegas but I am originally from Hawaii.  
I worked in building maintenance/construction field for the last few years after the Army. I am ready and  
looking forward to making a career change. I have always loved computers, I just couldn't see myself actually  
sitting behind the desk. I love being able to make what I need irl, so why not be able to do it on a pc. I  
spend a lot of time in web3 and I want to be able to fully immerse myself in that area.
