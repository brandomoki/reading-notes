# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
    * Small home computers came out at the time and ads were targeted towards boys.

1. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    * Because they had more experience with them. Computer UI at the time had to be executed with code. So having a home computer was a huge advantage.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
    * When they're driven by the company leaders

1. Why do diverse companies perform better?
    * Because these companies see more and in a differents ways that lead to faster or better production

1. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
    * A company simply offering a dark and light mode but they could also add a colorblind mode that changes certain colors would be a way to serve a diverse group. This comes with experience being that I am color blind and some websites just dont allow me to see certain things because they are using colors based on popular trends or the so called NORM.
