### Git VS GitHub

 + git and github are different things  

+ git lives on your pc

+ github is online not on your pc

+ git keeps history of changes

+ control systems

+ lets multiple devs work on the same code

+ commits are like snapshots with labels

+ git has a special label called head, that means you are here

+ merge conflicts

**Repository**
is a file system

1. git clone insert url

1. git status

1. git add (individually)

1. git add . (all)

1. git commit -m "commit message in detail"

1. git push origin main

1. git pull (retrieve from main)

**write in vs code to update your git on local**
