## sql modeling techniques

- Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

  - This is where one entry in one table can apply to many entries in other tables

- Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.

## sql vs nosql

- How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

  -  keywords are the reserved words that are used to perform various operations in the database
  - used to pass command values

- Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

  - defines data to a set of rules that must be followed

- Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

  - one to one meaning there is only one to the other nothing else 
  - one to many meaning there can be many outputs from the one source no other source but many outcomes
  - many to many this would be a relationship that all tables have access to the many
